# SAP-CPU

A VHDL description of the Ben Eater's 8bit cpu inspired by the SAP1 from the book Digital Computer Electronics - Malvino.

To do the behavioral simulation and see all the internal signals just run the commands from the sim file into ModelSim.

The cpu_tb.vhd file is used for the post-synthesis simulation only.
